##Part B
### Second Task
```{r}
sample1<-rlnorm(100,1,0.25)
hist(sample1,main = "Regular data")
```
Doesnt look normally distributed
```{r}
hist(log(sample1),main = "Logarithmized data")
```

Looks pretty normal!
```{r}
mean(sample1)
```
The mean is roughly 2.8. That is close to exp(1).
```{r}
var(sample1)
sd(log(sample1))
```
The variance of the sample rounds to 0.63.
